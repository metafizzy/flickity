### Reduced test case required

All bug reports and problem issues require a [**reduced test case**](http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/). Create one by forking any one of the [CodePen demos](http://codepen.io/desandro/tag/flickity-docs) from [the docs](http://flickity.metafizzy.co).

**CodePens**

+ [Basic](http://codepen.io/desandro/pen/azqbop)
+ [imagesLoaded](http://flickity.metafizzy.co/options.html#imagesloaded)
+ [lazyLoad](http://codepen.io/desandro/pen/vOeGzL)
+ [autoPlay](http://codepen.io/desandro/pen/RNQwaB)

**Test cases**

+ A reduced test case clearly demonstrates the bug or issue.
+ It contains the bare minimum HTML, CSS, and JavaScript required to demonstrate the bug.
+ A link to your production site is **not** a reduced test case.

Providing a reduced test case is the best way to get your issue addressed. They help you point out the problem. They help me verify and debug the problem. They help others understand the problem. Without a reduced test case, your issue may be closed.
